JsEvaluator
===========

This project consist of the source code that I used for a presentation about
the use of FsLex and FsYacc for creating parsers in F#.

The solution is a small parser for a small language with a JavaScript like
syntax. But this is no where near a complete parser. It is only meant to
demonstrate some of the principles of parsing input, generating syntax trees,
and consuming these in an evaluator.
